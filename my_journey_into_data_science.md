## My Journey into Data Science 

"Why are you interested in Data Science? What was your background before getting into this field?" These are questions that I have been asked a lot lately. Since my LinkedIn profile does not seems to provide a straightforward answer, I will connect the dots and answer these questions in this blog post. 

The ["TL;DR"](https://www.howtogeek.com/435266/what-does-tldr-mean-and-how-do-you-use-it/) version: my interests in Data Science are two-fold: the **theoretical** framework behind many subjects in data science, and their **practical applications**. My background in studying philosophy of language and formal logic, and my working experience in the non-profit sector make my transition into the field of data science a necessary and natural one.

Okay, if you are still interested in learning more details, buckle up and read on:

### From Philosophy to Data Science

Among many other topics in Data Science, what interests me the most is the theory behind and the development of **natural language processing**. More specifically, I am interested in how natural language processing deals with sentences such as: "I think that unicorns are real animals" or "I believe that snow is pink" (such sentences are known as [Propositional Attitudes](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prop-attitude-reports/) in analytic philosophy). "Why does this question matter?", you might ask. Well, let's play a little thought game before I move forward.  

> Let's consider the following scenario: After years of dating, Lois Lane still has absolutely no idea that her lover, Clark Kent, is the very same person as the superhero who she has a crash on, Superman (how this plot makes any sense, though, is beyond the scope of my blog post). Now let's consider the following two statements:
>
>   1. Lois Lane believes that Superman wears tight spandex and flies around to save people's lives. 
>   2. Lois Lane believes that Clark Kent wears tight spandex and flies around to save people's lives. 
> 
> Which of the two sentences do you consider true (in the DC universe, of course)? 
> 
> This seems to be a no brainer: the first one. However, since Superman and Clark Kent is the very same person, why can't we switch them in these two sentences and still get the same result?  

Feeling perplexed? You are not alone! This seemingly easy question (known as [Frege's Puzzle](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/prop-attitude-reports/#FrePuz) has triggered decades-long debates among philosophers and logicians. I was first exposed to Frege's theory when I was an exchange student studying philosophy at University of GÃ¶ttingen in Germany. My studies there kindled my interests in philosophy of language, formal logic, and early analytic philosophy. In the following five years, I spent significant amounts of time thinking on and studying this subject and related topics, and gained two Master's degrees along the way (MA in German Language and literature at University at Colorado Boulder; MA in philosophy at New York University). 

Although I studied this subject from different angles -- such as epistemology, literary theory, formal logic, etc. -- I always aspired to find new ways of thinking that can shed some light on this topic. This led me to take a graduate level course at NYU about [philosophy of programming languages](http://lambda.jimpryor.net/), where I had my first exposure to functional programming languages, such as OCaml and Haskell, and the [lambda calculus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus). Learning programming languages was the start of a new era for me: the ability to think programmatically provides me with a new tool for thinking and studying philosophical questions. Since then, I started learning Python and SQL on my own, and have had so much fun that I decided to pivot my career path towards a field where I can learn more. Over the years, I have noticed that many philosophical subjects that I am interested in have directed me towards research related to Data Science.  

### From Non-profit to Data Science

While I enjoy studying meaning on a philosophical level, I also find meaning in connecting with my local communities. Since 2014, I have volunteered at various non-profit organizations that focus on education and social justice. My volunteer experience led me to my first job in the non-profit sector after graduating from NYU. Since then, I have worked for two non-profit companies in New York City on various data related projects. 

One of my very first tasks on the job was to complete several grant applications (For those who are not familiar with the grant application process, it is one of the main functions for non-profit development teams to secure funding for the company). One essential component of a compelling grant application is to provide statistics about a company's program outcomes. "What data is relevant? Where do I find such data? How do I analyze them? How can I communicate the data in a meaningful and intuitive way? ..." A million questions popped up in my head and I was on a quest to find the solution. Naturally, I found myself facing a deep learning curve: Cleaning data was never as easy as I imagined; The source data existed in many forms and locations (the company website's backend, Excel spreadsheets in many different folders, a pile of filled-out survey forms in the corner that was collecting dust etc.); Analyzing data and presenting my findings was challenging as well without formal training. Although I was able to submit many grant applications and secure fundings for my company, I felt the need for learning more about data analysis. 

In the past three years, I have worked on various data related projects, such as providing data for grant applications, generating statistic reports to support the company's marketing plans and new fundraising campaigns, managing donor databases and maintaining data integrity etc. Along the way, I was able to help both companies establish some basic framework for how to handle data. However, I realized that much more needed to be done in order to help a small company fully utilize their data in an effective way. I also realized my lack of training in Data Science prevented me from contributing to the company in a transformative way. Thus, I decided to make the jump by joining the Data Science Immersive Course at General Assembly. 

This sums up my non-liner, but destined journey into the filed of Data Science, where my studies in philosophy and my work experience in non-profits finally conjoined. Currently, wrapping up my second week into the course, I am thrilled to see the journey has accelerated at a pace like never before. I look forward to reporting back about my learning progress. Stay tuned!
